# Hachiko

This Project is part of the [Chingu.io](https:chingu.io) Voyages - Voyage 19 - [V19-Toucans-Team-01]

## Description

Hachik≈ç is an application created for users to search for adoptable pets in locations all over the United States. During the 2020 pandemic, pet adpotions hit the charts as people craved companionship during isolated times. Hachiko is our contribution to continue pet adoptions even after quarantines have been lifted.
